A JS debugger utility

Testing
-------

1. In order to run the tests you need to have NodeJS installed. The first time
run ./install.sh to install all the depedencies needed to run the tests.

2. When you have installed your depedencies then execute ./run.sh to run the
tests.

**Both install.sh and run.sh scripts are working in Linux and MacOSX for now**
